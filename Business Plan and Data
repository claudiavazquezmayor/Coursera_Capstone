# Introducti√≥n
Madrid is a global city with a great rate for new opportunities of business. 
The aim of this project is to find which is the best location to open a new restaurant in the Spain capital.

The new restaurant is supposed to have healthy menus for having lunch and breakfast, in order to be the favourite place to have luch of business employees.
For this reason, the target group of the restuarant are the followings:
- Male or female workers of companies with good salaries.
- Who will want to eat outside every day, for schedule reasons.
- Who are really concerned about the quality of the products.
